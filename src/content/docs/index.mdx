## What Is This Mewgenics Guide?

Mewgenics is not a game where one lucky cat solves everything. It is a long-form strategy loop built around breeding, class roles, survival pressure, and base maintenance. This homepage is a focused **mewgenics guide** for players who want better decisions with less guesswork. Use it to connect genetics, food economy, class planning, and furniture upgrades in one workflow.

## Why Players Use This Wiki

- It is practical: every section is built around decisions you must make during a run.
- It is connected: beginner advice links directly to breeding, class, and furniture references.
- It is updated: balance notes and guide refinements are tracked in a visible update log.
- It is readable: short sections, scan-friendly lists, and direct links to the next action.

## How It Works

### 1. Lock down survival first
Use the [Beginner's Guide](/guides/beginner/) to prevent early run collapse. You will learn baseline food targets, basic combat positioning, and hygiene management. The objective of this step is simple: stop losing runs to predictable mistakes.

### 2. Build your breeding pipeline
Move to [Breeding Mechanics](/guides/breeding/) once your economy is stable. Focus on inheritance quality, mutation risk, and retirement timing. A strong line is built by planning two generations ahead, not by holding one cat forever.

### 3. Scale through role synergy
When you can survive consistently, use the [Classes Database](/database/classes/) and [Furniture List](/database/furniture/) to optimize team composition and base output. Class role coverage plus smart room investment gives you reliable power without overextending resources.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this wiki good for complete beginners?
Yes. Start with the beginner page, then move into breeding and database references.

### What is the best first objective in a new run?
Build food stability and avoid avoidable damage. If your cats are starving, class planning will not save the run.

### How much food should I stock?
A safe baseline is at least 20 food while your roster grows.

### Should I keep one strong cat forever?
Usually no. Treat strong cats as genetic value to pass forward.

### Which classes should new players prioritize?
A balanced start is safer than pure damage.

### Does furniture matter early game?
Yes. Good furniture choices stabilize hygiene, healing, and resource flow.

### Is this site free and does it require signup?
This wiki is free to read, with no account required for core guides and database pages.

### How can I report mistakes or suggest updates?
