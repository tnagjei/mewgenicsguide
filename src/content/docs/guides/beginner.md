## 1. Never Fall in Love (The Breeding Rule)
Cats in Mewgenics are temporary. They will get old, retire, or die in battle.
* **Don't get attached** to a specific cat.
* Focus on **passing down stats**. If a cat has high HP, make sure to breed them before they retire.

## 2. Resource Management
:::tip[Critical Tip]
Always keep **20+ Food** in your inventory!
:::
Each cat consumes **1 Food per day**.
* If you run out of food, your cats will take permanent damage and eventually die.
* Prioritize upgrading your **Food Storage** early.

## 3. Combat Tactics
* **Tactical View:** Press `Middle Click` (or Y on controller) to see enemy health bars and hidden traps.
* **Kill the Birds:** Neutral birds on the map often drop stat-boosting items. Kill them whenever possible.
* **Healing:** Eating items off the floor (like scraps) can heal small amounts of HP.

## 4. Base Hygiene
Leaving poop in your house isn't just gross—it makes your cats sick.
* **Clean daily:** Assign one cat to clean duty if necessary.
* **Furniture:** Buying a *Litter Box* reduces the frequency of messes.
