## How Inheritance Works
When two cats breed, the kitten inherits stats based on a mix of the parents' genes.
* **Dominant Genes:** High stats have a higher chance of passing down.
* **Mutations:** There is a small chance for a random stat boost or drop.

Retiring a cat with full XP grants a "Legacy Bonus" to future generations!
